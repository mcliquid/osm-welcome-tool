Hello {{ mapper.displayName }}

thank you for your first contribution to OpenStreetMap and welcome to the OSM community in the four-country region around Lake Constance and the Rhine Valley!

If you have any questions, we would like to help you: As a first point of contact I recommend our [**Forum**](https://community.openstreetmap.org). There you can easily register with your existing OSM account and ask questions or just get in contact with other mappers.

Especially in the beginning it can still be very overwhelming what you can map in OSM. A very easy way to get started with OpenStreetMap is to use the [**Android app StreetComplete**](https://streetcomplete.app/), which allows you to easily complete your neighborhood by answering short questions. Try it out on your next walk right away!

Here are a few more links to get you started:

* I recommend using the [Tips for Beginners](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Beginners%27_guide).
* If you can't figure out how to map something with the editor of your choice, the quickest solution is to look at [Map Features](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:Map_Features) on the wiki.
* [learnOSM](https://learnosm.org/de/) is a good place to learn more about OSM. There are instructions for using the iD browser editor and the more advanced JOSM editor.

Have fun mapping and being part of the OSM community!
